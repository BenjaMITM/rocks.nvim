# `rocks.nvim` (WIP)

A modern approach to Neovim plugin management.

> **Note**
> The following plugin is perfectly usable, but its user interfaces are a **work in progress**.
>
> They will be fledged out soon! :)

## :star2: Features

- `Cargo`-like `rocks.toml` file for declaring all your plugins
- Name-based installation (`use "nvim-neorg/neorg"` becomes `:Rocks install neorg` instead)
- Automatic dependency and build script management
- True semver versioning!
- (WIP) Automatic running of test suites

## Installation

<!-- Nix users have a skill issue here what else can I say.
Just joking - add an entry for nix users as well. -->

> **Important**
> Ensure you have [`luarocks`](https://luarocks.org) installed on your system and accessible in your shell.

<!-- TODO: Maybe make a bootstrap script? -->
